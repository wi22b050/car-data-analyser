# STEP 1

Please make sure you read the documentation for an explanation of the project.

# STEP 2 

Install the requirements.txt file

# STEP 3 

Run uvicorn main:app --reload to load your FastApi in order to see the visualisations.

# How the logic works: Currently all datasets are analyzed and visualisations could be directly created. But if you want to run all the code, you should do it in this specific order: 

# First: Run the web_data_extractor.py
# Second: Run bmw_data_processor.py
# Third: Run uvicorn main:app --reload

# Please note, that if you do intend to run bmw_data_processor and web_data_extractor, it is possible you might have to set the specific paths of the csv files in analyse_data.py, web_data_extractor.py, bmw_data_processor.py.
